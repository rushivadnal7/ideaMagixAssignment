Iâ€™ve successfully completed the webpage as per the requirements.
It is fully responsive, matches the design exactly, includes lazy loading for images,
Owl Carousel sliders, and a seamless page loader. 

One more thing is that due to my ongoing semester exams , it was hard to complete the assignment on time . but still i did it . but personally i feel i could have done more better if it was some another day . i hope so , i'll be selected and get an opportunity to showcase my skills more and add value to the team. Thankyou!
